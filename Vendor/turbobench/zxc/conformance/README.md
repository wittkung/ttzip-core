# ZXC Decoder Conformance Suite

Reference test vectors for validating any ZXC decoder implementation.

## Contents

```
valid/
  *.zxc         Compressed files (frozen wire format)
  *.expected    Expected decompressed output (plaintext reference)
invalid/
  *.zxc         Malformed files that must be rejected
```

## Validating a decoder

For each `valid/*.zxc`:

1. Decompress the file with your decoder
2. Compare the output byte-for-byte against the matching `.expected` file
3. Any mismatch is a decoder bug

For each `invalid/*.zxc`:

1. Attempt to decompress the file with your decoder
2. The decoder **must** reject it (return an error, not produce output)
3. Accepting a malformed file is a decoder bug

## Quick check (shell)

```sh
pass=0; fail=0
for f in valid/*.zxc; do
    expected="${f%.zxc}.expected"
    your-decoder "$f" /tmp/out
    if cmp -s /tmp/out "$expected"; then
        pass=$((pass + 1))
    else
        echo "FAIL: $f"; fail=$((fail + 1))
    fi
done
for f in invalid/*.zxc; do
    if your-decoder "$f" /dev/null 2>/dev/null; then
        echo "FAIL (should reject): $f"; fail=$((fail + 1))
    else
        pass=$((pass + 1))
    fi
done
echo "Passed: $pass  Failed: $fail"
```

| PivCo (L7)           | 1     | Level-7 PivCo sections (v7 enc 2, level-ordered bits) |
| Block size variants  | 2     | 4 KB and 2 MB block sizes                        |
| Checksum             | 3     | Per-block and global checksum enabled             |
