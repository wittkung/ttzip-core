# Specification Quality Checklist: 214-xz-arm64-crc64-remediation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-08-23  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details leaking into abstract requirements
- [x] Focused on user value and software robustness
- [x] Written with clear, objective technical terminology
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (verifiable via test binaries)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases (missing HWCAP, big endian, old glibc) are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] Upstream project and worktree context explicitly specified

## Notes

- Feature classified as `[Full SDD]`.
- Ready for next phase: `speckit-clarify` or `speckit-plan`.
